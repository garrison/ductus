INSTALLATION
------------

You need the flex SDK (v4.6 or more recent) to compile the flash swf file from this source code.
You can obtain the SDK from https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html

Before compiling:
Edit the Makefile to point have MXMLC pointing at the flex compiler.
By default, extracting the SDK archive under /usr/local (on unix compatible systems) should get you all set.

Edit DUCTUS_ROOT to point to the root of your ductus installation.

Then run:
make
make install (will copy wami.swf where ductus javascript code expects it)
