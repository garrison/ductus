Ductus modules

Ductus itself is a framework for building wikis of structured data.  Everything
that a site needs beyond a generic framework for a structured wiki is provided
in modules.  These modules define the specific types of structured data
(e.g. types of language lessons) and the relevant views specific to a use case.
