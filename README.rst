 ``Ductus``
============

Ductus is a wiki system designed to handle arbitrarily-structured
content and a variety of workflows. It is free software licensed under
the GNU GPL version 3 or later. Currently it is used by the Wikiotics_
language instruction project.

With Ductus, programmers can easily define classes of structured
content, providing rich mechanisms for user interaction. For instance,
Wikiotics allows people to collaborate on "language lessons," which
can later be used as quizzes or flashcards. Such modes of interaction
are not possible with most wikis which are designed primarily to
handle freely-structured text.
